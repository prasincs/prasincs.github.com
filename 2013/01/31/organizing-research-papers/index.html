<p>I keep finding myself asking this question way too often</p>

<pre><code>I definitely read that in a paper (or, blog post, quora article) a while back, where was it?
</code></pre>

<p>Most often it&rsquo;s either in one of my moleskine notebooks (seriously, those things are incredible - I keep two), date stamped with some scribble or on Evernote. I don&rsquo;t get annotations and in-place notes. I like to scribble on the side a fair bit and annotate. While iAnnotate apps work, I can&rsquo;t save that to Evernote yet, while keeping it editable. While I&rsquo;m pretty sure Evernote or Dropbox can be adapted to do all of this with some cleverness or discipline, but here&rsquo;s some of the research I did on how to organize your documents, research papers.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want">What I want</h2>

<p>The ideal research note-taking application would let me do few things:</p>

<h3 id="keeping-track">Keeping Track</h3>

<p>Keep track of what I&rsquo;m reading (goodreads attempts this for books, but I mean across devices).</p>

<h3 id="synced-annotations-and-notes">Synced Annotations and Notes</h3>

<p>Editable annotations and notes, I&rsquo;d like to be able to read papers at the airport on my iPad, make notes in-place and when I reach my home, I can organize into a distilled document.</p>

<h3 id="tagging">Tagging</h3>

<p>I think I can do the two I mentioned earlier with kindle to some extent. What Kindle doesn&rsquo;t give but Evernote does is tagging. I can organize things any way I want with tags.</p>

<h3 id="cross-platform">Cross Platform</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like it to run on the iPad, Android, and the browser.. I don&rsquo;t exactly care much about client applications, they&rsquo;re nice to have in addition to these.</p>

<h3 id="bibliography-wherever-applicable-bibtex">Bibliography wherever applicable (BibTeX)</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m lazy, and so are most people, I&rsquo;d like to get BibTeX format documentation generated for me wherever it makes sense, if I got it off of some researcher or some site. It should let me add these if I just got the PDF and I want to keep track. The use case I&rsquo;m thinking is, if I&rsquo;m writing a new paper, I&rsquo;d like to be able to tag with something, and just get a list of BibTeX annotations to paste for LaTeX to generate in whatever format I want.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration-sharing">Collaboration, Sharing</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t research alone, unless it&rsquo;s the time-honored tradition of searching for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf_IIbT8HGk">cat videos</a>, even that reddit probably has got to be the journal of sorts. Actually, on that note, I ran into <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0046362">this paper</a> on how viewing cute images promotes a careful behavior and narrows attention focus. Believe it or not, I ran into it via <a href="https://plus.google.com/105332691637769400620/posts/V77u6LeFAYy">Sanjay Ghemawat&rsquo;s G+ post</a>. There you go, with enough cute pics, you might come up with BigTable.</p>

<p>Back to the topic, I&rsquo;d like to share with other people what I&rsquo;m reading and ideally maintain a &ldquo;burn list&rdquo; of sorts with colleagues on what papers I&rsquo;m reading for a particular project. There&rsquo;s some &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; part here that you get for cheap but I can barely get around to reading what I plan on reading.</p>

<h3 id="importing-other-sources">Importing other sources</h3>

<p>PDFs, web pages, not just research articles</p>

<h2 id="possible-tools-that-get-it">Possible tools that &ldquo;get it&rdquo;</h2>

<p>So far I think Mendeley comes the closest to this grand vision (it didn&rsquo;t do tracking last time I used it but matters less than others), but there are others, this is by no means comprehensive.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/features/">Mendeley</a> &ndash; good tool, I used it extensively for some research at school, beginning to use it again.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> &ndash; I know some people who swear by it, I think it lacks on some of the other features like collaboration, being cross-platform but it does a damn good job of organizing</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> &ndash; Not all the things I find interesting are research papers, evernote lets me &ldquo;clip&rdquo; online articles, I can scan paper docs and have it OCR so I can research it in future.. all that good stuff. I use it a lot for keeping notes anyway.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://zotero.com">Zotero</a> &ndash; I know people who like it, didn&rsquo;t find it too appealing myself</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.docear.org/">Docear</a> &ndash; same thing as Papers, really good at organzing, I haven&rsquo;t used it but I&rsquo;ve seen it mentioned</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to suggest new ones in the comments, I&rsquo;m not trying to be extensive. I think <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> and <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com">StackExchange</a> do that fairly well. :)</p>
