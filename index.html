</header>


        
          <p>I recently switched from using own hosted Docker Registry to the amazon hosted Elastic Container Registry and found that the UI, well, sucks. The results aren&rsquo;t returned in any kind of sorted order and the UI doesn&rsquo;t help you do that. In addition, it&rsquo;s the same issue with the cli tool. I wish they included a timestamp field to know when the layer/image was created but in absence of that, the image tag are the best we have to go with.</p>

          <p>I keep running into situations where I find myself at a cafe or something where I&rsquo;d rather not send all my traffic through work VPN. So alternatively, I use a SOCKS5 proxy for that. That works well for browsing, etc but what about applications I&rsquo;m developing as well. Thankfully Go has a library that makes proxy aware http Clients really easy to write.
It&rsquo;s not executable, but I uploaded my example on Go Playground.</p>

          <p>Following on my previous post on Getting Starting with Open StreetMap for Nepal, I wanted to look at the open datasets and GIS shapefiles that people have been sharing. Given the lack of additional data and poor satellite image resolution, being able to delineate Village Development Committee (VDC) would be great help, in my opinion. Here&rsquo;s how to setup the JOSM tool to do so. We&rsquo;ll get the data from HDX Data repository in the form of zip files to open in JOSM.</p>

          <p>As you must be well aware of the enormous toll the earthquake has taken for Nepal by now, there&rsquo;s still work you can do to help the boots on the ground doing rescue work by helping map the affected regions. Basically, outside of major towns and cities, Nepal&rsquo;s landscape is very hilly &ndash; there are few if any roads to most villages. It doesn&rsquo;t help in rescue efforts now that all the villages are reduced to rubbles.</p>

          <p>I have recently been working on fixing some personal pain-points for Docker. It came about because of a course I am taking at UConn this fall on Troubleshooting Distributed Systems - Excellent course by the way.
The current issue I&rsquo;m looking at is the one about logging. Yep, I somehow managed to volunteered to do this in a month with a full-time job and 4 hours a week of driving back and forth from UConn.</p>

          <p>So, I recently signed up for a Distributed Systems course at UConn (http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~mok11002/public_html/cse5095_fall2014.htm). It involves a lot of reading and writing reviews. I have always written these class assignments in LaTeX except when I have been expressedly forbidden from using it. However, there&rsquo;s a whole gamut of problems with writing in LaTeX directly. Partly, you may not always be in a place where your environment is sane. So, being able to store as plaintext/markdown would be awesome.</p>

          <p>Update: I know this is about a year late. I should do git stash pop more often. Also, after tweaking Jekyll Bootstrap too much I&rsquo;ve decided to give up and port to something sane like Ghost or Octopress.
The Five Stages of Grief Here is a cycle I see repeating in programmers (including myself) whenever a static analyzer is introduced in build process too late in the game.

          <p>Caveat This isn&rsquo;t very well written, I might revisit this at some point. These are really just my notes in installing emacs and some reasons why I&rsquo;m going out of the vim world in response to some crazy issues I&rsquo;m having.
I recently decided that I should give Emacs another go. As you might know based on my posts that I really like vim. It&rsquo;s just simple and easy to find everywhere.</p>

          <p>So, the more I use Go, more I like what I&rsquo;m getting. It&rsquo;s one of the very few languages that guides you to write better code right off the bat by making it easy and not pedantic. I have a big rant in my head about this but I&rsquo;ll save you the pain.
This was one thing my vim setup was missing. As my go programs became bigger, I kept thinking, I&rsquo;d really like better autocomplete and, heck, even syntax highlighting.</p>
