So, I finally decided to port this site to Jekyll-Bootstrap along with a bunch of other projects. There are some helper functions in Jekyll Bootstrap that I find very convenient to use. Particularly since I'm using ruby/rake all the time, it's easier to just run the `rake post` command to just post whatever you need to. I'll add a few more things in the future. Right now, I'm just testing a bunch of things and didn't exactly pay much attention to making the site look good.
